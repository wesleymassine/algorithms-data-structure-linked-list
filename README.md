# Algorithms and data structure with Linked List

(EN)

This repository contains my studies on algorithms and data structure with questions,
classic problems and challenges that are part of the fundamentals of computer science.

In this package, the solutions are implemented in the `Java` programming language using` Linked List`.

The proposed problems are with the questions and details for solution commented at the beginning of each class.java file.
